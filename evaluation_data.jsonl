{"chat_history":[],"question":"What is antioxidant nutrient?", "ground_truth": "Antioxidant nutrients are compounds that protect cells from oxidative damage caused by free radicals, which are produced during normal metabolism, and exposure to environmental factors like tobacco smoke and radiation. They include vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and selenium. Antioxidants are believed to have a protective effect against heart diseases, cancer, and other diseases. However, the evidence for their health benefits is still inconclusive. Some studies suggest that taking high doses of antioxidant supplements may even be harmful, so it's important to get these nutrients through a balanced diet. \nSOURCES:\n- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249911/\n- https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-Consumer/\n- https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminE-Consumer/\n- https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/BetaCarotene-Consumer/\n- https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-Consumer/"}
