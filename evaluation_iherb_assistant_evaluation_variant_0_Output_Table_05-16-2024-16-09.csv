"What is Biotin?","Biotin is part of the B vitamin family and is a coenzyme for five carboxylases in the human body. It is essential for amino acid catabolism, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid metabolism. Biotin is also necessary for gene stability because it is covalently attached to histones. Normally, the amount of biotin in the body is regulated by dietary intake, biotin transporters, peptidyl hydrolase biotinidase (BTD), and the protein ligase holocarboxylase synthetase. Biotin deficiency is a nutritional disorder which can become serious, even fatal, if allowed to progress untreated. It can occur in people of any age, ancestry, or of either sex. Biotin deficiency rarely occurs among healthy people because the daily requirement of biotin is low, many foods provide adequate amounts of it, and intestinal bacteria synthesize small amounts of it. Genetic disorders such as multiple carboxylase deficiency (MCD), which includes biotinidase deficiency and holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency, can also lead to inborn or late-onset forms of biotin deficiency. In all cases – dietary, genetic, or otherwise – supplementation with biotin is the primary (and usually only) method of treatment. The average dietary intake of biotin ranges between 35 and 70 micrograms/day in the western population.  Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Biotin+deficiency.","","Biotin, also known as vitamin H or vitamin B7, is a water-soluble vitamin that is part of the B complex vitamins. It is a coenzyme that plays a vital role in several metabolic processes in the body, including the breakdown of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. Biotin is essential for the growth and maintenance of healthy hair, skin, and nails, and it also helps support the health of the nervous system and liver. Biotin is found naturally in a variety of foods, including eggs, nuts, fish, meat, and dairy products. Some people also take biotin supplements to support their overall health and wellness.","5","3","2","0.3","0","Completed"

"What is antioxidant nutrient?","Antioxidant nutrients are a type of nutrient that inhibits the oxidation of other molecules and are often found in food. These nutrients include vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and selenium. They defend cells from damage caused by potentially harmful molecules known as free radicals. Antioxidants are believed to play a role in the prevention of many chronic diseases, such as heart disease and cancer. However, more research is needed to establish the full extent of their impact on human health. 
SOURCES: 
- https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/301506
- https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antioxidants-explained#what-they-are","","Antioxidant nutrients are compounds that protect cells from oxidative damage caused by free radicals, which are produced during normal metabolism, and exposure to environmental factors like tobacco smoke and radiation. They include vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and selenium. Antioxidants are believed to have a protective effect against heart diseases, cancer, and other diseases. However, the evidence for their health benefits is still inconclusive. Some studies suggest that taking high doses of antioxidant supplements may even be harmful, so it's important to get these nutrients through a balanced diet.
